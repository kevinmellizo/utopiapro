The world has already assimilated the idea that the economy has changed and will continue to do so faster and faster, having a greater effect on society and the way we live. We define digital ecosystem as a new industrial context and economic and social impact, resulting from the mass adoption of digital information and communication technologies. One of the consequences of digital transformation is that we are producing data exponentially. Data has a direct and decisive influence on how consumers behave, capitalizing on this data will be a critical part of human development with digital and technological innovation platforms that will change the way the world works.
